# Formula-Directory-v2
--Second version of the Formula Directory, now with a search function instead of series buttons!
--To initialize everything run Interface2. 
--Running Database2 will only count the number of formulas in each series, in total, and the total number of 
combinations assuming a maximum of three vials per subject.
